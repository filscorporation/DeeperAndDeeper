# To The Planet Core
Game made for Ludum Dare 48 with theme Deeper And Deeper

Reach bottom of the map untill all your blocks are frozen!

## Controls
Select block to place in bottom left and click near existing block to attach. Use mouse scroll to move camera.

## How to play
Game goal is to reach the bottom of the map where you can find lava.
As time passes top blocks will become frozen, so you need to hurry.
Your building blocks cost iron, so you need to mine ore to sustain construction. Additional ores will allow you to make buy upgrades.
Main game mechanic is blocks physics - each block will compute overall upper presure and load of it's side's mounts. If any block can't be held - it will destroy.
